# UFO's <br> Unidentified Flying Objects
ðŸŒŒ Observing a world _**beyond**_ our own ðŸŒŒ

## Overview 

The purpose of this website was to take a `JavaScript` dataset and use it to create a table that can be filtered through using multiple different criteria (city, country, UFO shape, etc...). Users can filter through the data and see if any UFO's have been sighted in thier area. Once created, this data is housed on an `HTML` that can easily be visited and viewed if hosted on a server.  

## Using The Site

### Landing Page
When opening the site, users will be greeted with an image of our earth at night with a short paragraph and the beginning of a large table. This table holds all of the data that has been taken from the Data.JS, ran through functions and displayed here on our HTML site. Here is the main landing page:

### Filters 
Once the user is familiar with the table and the different criteria that can be used to search, the can head over to the filters on the left side of the page. Here, users can input anywhere from one to 5 different filters. Once the information is inputted by the user, the background code (`app.JS`) will run the table building function with the provided filters and return a table that displays the data the user is looking for. For example, if someone was looking UFO sightings in San Diego, CA, that happened on 1/5/2010 and were triangle shaped, this would be the result:

They would be in luck because there was exactly one reported incident with that specific criteria.
