# UFO's <br> Unidentified Flying Objects
ðŸŒŒ Observing a world _**beyond**_ our own ðŸŒŒ

## Overview 

The purpose of this website was to take a `JavaScript` dataset and use it to create a table that can be filtered through using multiple different criteria (city, country, UFO shape, etc...). Users can filter through the data and see if any UFO's have been sighted in thier area. Once created, this data is housed on an HTML that can easily be visited and viewed if hosted on a server.
